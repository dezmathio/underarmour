# Underarmour

A ruby wrapper for the Under Armour API

## Disclaimer

This is very much still a work in progress & likely to change, feel free to contribute however you find fit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'underarmour'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install underarmour
    
## Setup Key Access from UnderArmour API for your app
You need to have access_key and api_key from the Under Armour API. This can be received from,
    https://developer.underarmour.com/signup

Your application needs to pass these keys to the underarmour gem by using dotenv. In your Gemfile add,

``` gem 'dotenv-rails' ```

Add the keys to the file .env in the repo home. The contents of the .env file will look like 

```
access_token=<your-value>
api_key=<your-value>
```

In your client code, include the following,

``` require 'dotenv/load' ```

Now you should be able to access the environment variable set in .env by using ENV['access_token'] and ENV['api_key']
    
## Usage

### Retrieve a User

```ruby

user = Underarmour::ApiClient.scoped_api_client(Underarmour::User, 'user/', access_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN', api_key: 'YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY').find_self

```

### Retrieve an ActivityType

```ruby

activity_type = Underarmour::ApiClient.scoped_api_client(Underarmour::ActivityType, 'activity_type/',access_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN', api_key: 'YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY').find(215)

```
